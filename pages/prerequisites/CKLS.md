We systematically test the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge browsers to ensure the best experience for our users. Older versions of these browsers are not systematically tested, but run smoothly in most cases. If, however, there is a problem specific to a particular version of one of these browsers, please contact us.

These technical requirements may be modified according to technical developments of CrossKnowledge solutions.
In addition to those, specific requirements apply to:
- Blendedˣ Embedded Web Resource Activity and Embedded BI tool in Analyze workspace: these features are used to integrate a 3rd party content from the web. CrossKnowledge can not guaranty the compatibility of the integrated content

In order to ensure a good user experience for Blendedˣ Embedded Content Activity, please ensure that SCORM contents are built to be responsive. For example, no Flash should be included in the SCORM content.


### Tablet compatibility

CrossKnowledge Learning Suite is compatible with iPad (2, 3, 4 and mini) - additional requirements may be needed for the content hosted on the Learning Suite.

CrossKnowledge Learning Suite is compatible with Android tablets (Chrome browser) - additional requirements may be needed for the content hosted on the Learning Suite. 

Please note that SCORM and AICC connectors are not optimized for mobile usage

### CK Flow (Nifi) IP addresses
```txt
Production  : 18.197.1.205/32 ; 18.196.218.103/32 ; 35.157.172.172/32 ; 52.209.221.119/32 ; 54.78.53.27/32 ; 3.125.172.227 ; 3.65.7.102 ; 3.64.247.80
Non production : 54.77.181.243/32 ; 63.35.39.89/32 ; 63.32.16.200/32
```

## Email servers requirements

@crossknowledge.com domain must be whitelisted as a trusted sender. 

### Supported email configuration scenario :

<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">

<tbody><tr>
<td>All emails are sent by Amazon SES service from crossknowledge.com domain
</td>
<td>CKLS sends emails using a FROM address that belongs to crossknowledge.com domain only. (default and preferred solution)<br>
<p>The client's email address is kept in the REPLYTO field <br>
E.g&nbsp;: user john.doe@client.com sends an email to someone, the received email will have the following attributes <br>
</p>
<pre>FROM:noreply@crossknowledge.com
REPLYTO:john.doe@client.com
</pre>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>All emails are sent by Amazon SES service using a FROM address that belongs to the client's domain (or crossknowledge.com domain)
</td>
<td>
<p>This setup requires some extra IT configuration tasks for both CrossKnowledge and client's IT Teams&nbsp;: DKIM entries to be added in client's DNS zone&nbsp;: client.com. <br>
E.g mail can be sent from noreply@client.com or any other @client.com addresses. <br>
In case an email having a FROM attribute not belonging to either client.com or crossknowledge.com domain, the FROM attribute is automatically replaced by noreply@client.com or any other generic address chosen by the client during the setup phase.
Dedicated IPs can be used for whitelisting or security purposes.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>All emails are sent directly by the client's SMTP relay
</td>
<td>
<p>CKLS application is then authorised to directly pass emails flow to a remote client's relay.<br>
CrossKnowledge will not provide any IP ranges (autoscalling CKLS servers may have various IPs changing regularly) however SMTP session can be secured by a TLS login and password (to be provided by Client's Email team).
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

Maximum message size (including attachments) is limited to 10 MB per message (after base64 encoding).

### Mail servers' IP addresses and whitelist

At the time of this writing, these are the IP ranges used by AWS SES:

```txt
199.255.192.0/22 199.127.232.0/22 54.240.0.0/18 69.169.224.0/20
```
However these ranges may change, so to get an up to date list, please run the following command: 
From a Linux or Mac OS system:
```txt
$ dig TXT amazonses.com +short| grep 'v=spf1'
```
From a Windows system
```txt
C:>nslookup -type=TXT amazonses.com | find "v=spf1"
```
Emails can also be sent from this spare IP :
```
174.129.245.244/32
```
and for CKLS instances created before September 2017 and still hosted by Jaguar Network, please add also:
```
85.31.192.42/32 85.31.193.42/32 174.129.245.244/32
```
### Hostnames of SMTP relays and custom MAIL FROM domains used for sending 	

```txt
