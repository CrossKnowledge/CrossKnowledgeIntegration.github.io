## Workstation requirements 

The first requirement and mandatory one, is having the possibility to access Amazon Cloud URLs and IPs adresses.

TeamSHIFT is a new CrossKnowledge solution which requires the following environment on the customer side to run properly:

<table>

### Email servers requirements

##### Mail servers' IP addresses and whitelist

TeamShift relies on Amazon SES service for sending emails. 
At the time of this writing, these are the IP ranges used by AWS SES:

```txt
199.255.192.0/22 199.127.232.0/22 54.240.0.0/18
Emails can also be sent from this spare IP : 174.129.245.244/32
no-reply@crossknowledge.com should be whitelisted
```
However these range may change so in order to get an up to date list, please run the following command 
From a Linux or Mac OS system:
```txt
$ dig TXT amazonses.com +short| grep 'v=spf1'
```
From a Windows system
```txt
C:>nslookup -type=TXT amazonses.com | find "v=spf1"
```

#### Hostnames of SMTP relays and custom "MAIL FROM" domains used for sending 	

```txt
email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
sesmailna.crossknowledge.com
email-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
sesmaileu.crossknowledge.com
smtp01.crossknowledge.com
```
