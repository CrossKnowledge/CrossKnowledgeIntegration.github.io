## Content

In order to see all CrossKnowledge content on your mobile device, you need to have the cloud option activated. This option will make sure that our CrossKnowledge content are hosted on our cloud solutions.

My Learning is optimized to open SCORM/AICC packages/connectors in frame mode and not in pop-up mode.

## Offline content

My Learning allows downloading Blendedx and Learning Channel learning resources offline, to view them with no connectivity.

To download offline learning resources, the usersâ€™ devices must have enough space on their local storage to host those files. In addition, to avoid overhead or bandwidth limit, we strongly recommend having learning resources on our platform with a size inferior as 200 Mb. We also recommend having your phone plugged in on the power for downloading.

Get in touch with your local phone provider, while using cellular network, to make sure there are not any limitation.

We also recommend using wifi connection to download learning resources.

## Note on network prerequisites

If users are connected to the corporate network, you need to ensure that this network complies with our prerequisites, in term of IP whitelisting. You can have more information in [this page](https://developers.crossknowledge.com/CKLS-prerequisites).
