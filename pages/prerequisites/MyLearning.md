## Learn vs My Learning

Learn is our legacy mobile app. This mobile application is no longer supported, and is not available anymore on Apple and Google stores.

## Compatibility

My Learning is compatible with the following devices:
* Apple iOS: any device with iOS 11 and above
* Android: any device with Android Marshmallow 6.0 (API 23) and above - a non contractual list can be found [here](https://en.droidwiki.org/wiki/List_of_Android_version_names)
From December 1st 2019, My Learning will be supported on any device using Android Nougat 7 (API 25) and above.
* Windows Phone: we do not have a native app, and we did not plan it, but our CKLS can be accessed via the browser.

It is available on both stores under CrossKnowledge My Learning

Latest mobile application version available on stores is the only supported version.
Please note that SCORM connectors are not optimized for mobile usage.

These technical requirements may be modified according to technical developments of CrossKnowledge solutions.

## Content

In order to see all CrossKnowledge content on your mobile device, you need to have the cloud option activated. This option will make sure that our CrossKnowledge content are hosted on Amazon.

## Offline content

My Learning allows downloading Blendedx learning resources offline, to view them with no connectivity.

To download offline learning resources, the usersâ€™ devices must have enough space on their local storage to host those files. In addition, to avoid overhead or bandwidth limit, we strongly recommend having learning resources on our platform with a size inferior as 200 Mb. We also recommend having your phone plugged in on the power for downloading.

Get in touch with your local phone provider, while using cellular network, to make sure there are not any limitation.

We also recommend using wifi connection to download learning resources.

## Note on network prerequisites

If users are connected to the corporate network, you need to ensure that this network complies with our prerequisites, in term of IP whitelisting. You can have more information in [this page](https://developers.crossknowledge.com/CKLS-prerequisites).
