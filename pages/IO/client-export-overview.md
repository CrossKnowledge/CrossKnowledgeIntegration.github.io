## What is the difference between all these tracking exports?

It is normal to misunderstood the differences between the tracking exports. If it is your case, we hope this section can help you!

A good way to think in these exports is in a pyramid form. As if the Tracking Log was the most detailed ("low level") and the Consolidated Tracking the most consolidated ("high level") export.

### Ok, but what does it mean?

All data you can have with Activity, Tracking, Class Based Training and Consolidated Tracking can be obtained with Tracking Log. Tracking log will be the most detailed information. And, if you want to group this informations for each learner in different levels, you can obtain the same result that you will have with others Tracking exports. Like a puzzle game!

But if you won't do that, we can provide you different visions of that data with our other Tracking exports. Sounds good? ðŸ˜‰

<!-- Partindo da base da pirÃ¢mide, os relatÃ³rios que vem acima irÃ£o utilizar os dados do relatÃ³rio abaixo como base para formar a visualizaÃ§Ã£o desses dados em diferentes nÃ­veis (mais consolidados). Ou seja, os dados apresentados no Tracking log, serÃ£o consolidados para apresentar a visÃ£o de tracking de conteÃºdo nos relatÃ³rios acima (Tracking, Class Based Training, Activity). Os dados de Activity serÃ£o formados pelos dados consolidados do Tracking log e os dados que vocÃª obtiver em Tracking e CBT tambÃ©m estarÃ£o presentes em Activity. E por fim o Consolidated Tracking serÃ¡ formado pelos dados dos relatÃ³rios abaixo dele, porÃ©m consolidado para uma visÃ£o de nÃ­vel de sessÃ£o. -->

* **Tracking log** will have each action that the learner did in a content. It is most used in audit situations, when a really detailed level is required. It is available for **Self-directed learning** training (as Learning Channel) and **Guided learning** training (as Blendedx). 
> Example: *"**Julie** accessed the Content A in Session 01 in Training 02 at 2020-15-03 and spent 00:00:30 seconds on it. She gained 0 points and the status is Incomplete on this registration. 
Also, **Julie** accessed the Content A in Session 01 in Training 02 at 2020-22-03 and spent 00:15:20 minutes on it. She gained 10 points and the status is Completed on this registration."*

* **Tracking** will consolidate only data related to Learning Resources in a content level. It is available for **Self-directed learning** training (as Learning Channel) and **Guided learning** training (as Blendedx). 
> Example: *"**Julie** accessed the Content A in Session 01 in Training 02 for the first time at 2020-15-03 and the last time at 2020-22-03. She spent 00:15:50 minutes on it. She gained 10 points and the Content status is Completed."*

* **Class Based Training (CBT)** will consolidate only data related to Classroom activity in a content level. It is available only for **Blendedx** training. It is most used when the client needs to have the report of face-to-face events registered at the platform. 
> Example: *"**Michael** has been attended the event Class ABC, registered in Session 02 in Training 02, that started at 2020-18-03 at 12:30:00 p.m and finished at 2020-19-03 at 06:00:00 p.m. He gained 30 points on this activity. This event occurred at London office, in Blue room, and the facilitator was Sophie Durand."*

* **Activity** will consolidate only data related to Blendedx activities (including Classroom activity) and some Learning Resources in a content level. It is most used when the client has **Blendedx** trainings and wants to know how each learner are doing. So, this report will have the same data that CBT report has and also some data (only when it is related to Blendedx training) that Tracking report has. On this report is possible to have the **NPS** rate that each learner assigned to the session.
> Example: *"**Julie** accessed the Content A in Session 01 in Training 02 for the first time at 2020-15-03 and last time at 2020-22-03. She spent 00:15:50 minutes on it. She gained 10 points and the Content status is Completed. She gave the score 07 to this session.
Also, **Michael** has been attended the event Class ABC, which started at 2020-18-03 and finished at 2020-19-03. He spent 11:30:00 hours on it. He gained 30 points and the Activity status is Completed. He gave the score 10 to this session."* 

* **Consolidated tracking** will consolidate all Activities and Learning Resouces in a session level. It is available for **Self-directed learning** training (as Learning Channel) and **Guided learning** training (as Blendedx). It is most used when the client wants to know how is the learner progress in some session/training. It is a high-level data (not so detailed as the other reports).
> Example: *"**Julie** did Session 01 in Training 02. Her first access was 2020-15-03 and the last access was at 2020-22-03. This session is incompleted yet. For now she spent 00:15:50 minutes on it and gained 10 points.
Also **Michael** did the Session 02 in Training 02. His first access was 2020-16-03 and the last access was 2020-22-03. This session is completed and he gained 50 points. He spent 15:00:00 hours on it.
