## Activity Tracking

It is only available for **Blendedx trainings**. Only activities and learning resources in Blendedx trainings will be exported. If there is a Learning Channel with learning resources, the tracking for those Learning Channel contents will not be exported.

If you want to have tracking exports only for learning resources, please take a look at [Tracking export](htttp://localhost:4000/tracking_export-tracking.html).


> Example: _**Laurie** did "**Welcome to our team!**" content in session "**Session 01**" in "**First steps**" training. It started on "**2020-02-20**" and finished on "**2020-03-30**". She earned "**30 points**" and the training status is "**Completed**"._
