dynamic_content: true

important_note: >
    This provider behaves as a "oneshot", or a "data create and replace": when you import one tracking row, it will replace the existing data. If you import the same file 10 times, it will not cumulate anything. 
    <br/>Also, you will need to import ALL the data. If you want to update the time spent of an existing tracking row, you need to put ALL the available columns in the CSV, otherwise you will update the time spent on your tracking, but you will reset the progress and access dates.
    <br/><br/>Unlike the other import providers, the settings for this provider need to be split in two blocks: <code class="highlighter-rouge">options</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">parameters</code>. 
    <br/>Please see the example below for more details.
columns: [candidateLogin, candidateRefNumber, candidateEmail, lovCode, lovGuid, sessionGuid, trainingPathCode, trainingId, 
    sessionTitle, sessionId, firstAccessDate, lastAccessDate, firstCompletionDate, progression, trackingStatus, timeSpent, 
    score, scoreMax, ignoredColumn]
parameters: [defaultScoreMax, dateTimeFormat, timeZone, defaultTime]

### Error Messages

Message | Explanation
---- | ----
`At least one of these element must be present: learning object version code or GUID.` | A tracking row needs to be associated to a learning object, therefore a reference (lovCode or lovGuid) has to be filled in the import file.
`This learning object is provided by CrossKnowledge, and this report cannot be updated.` | Reports for CrossKnowledge learning objects cannot be modified by the import process.
`This learning object is an EasyQuizz, and this report cannot be updated.`	| Reports for Easyquizz learning objects cannot be modified by the import process.
`At least one of these element must be present: learner login, reference number or email.` | A tracking needs to be associated to a learner, therefore a learner reference (candidateLogin, candidateRefNumber or candidateEmail) has to be filled in the import file.
`At least one of the following to provide a precise context : "session GUID" or the couple "session title" & "training code".'`	| A tracking needs to be associated to a context, therefore a context reference (sessionGuid, or sessionTitle and trainingPathCode) is required.
`No registration found for given parameters.` | Given the learner and session information from the import file, the application failed to identify a registration.
`You cannot set a first completion date if the LO is not completed.` | If during an import, the tracking row is "not completed" and firstCompletionDate is specified, then the row is rejected with the message: "You cannot set a first completion date if the LO is not completed".
