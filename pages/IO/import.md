## Structure of the configuration file

The XML configuration file defines the structure of the data import files.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<import-config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <import>
  	<preProcess>
	  ... <!-- list of preProcesses and their options -->
  	</preProcess>
    <providers>
      ... <!-- list of providers and their options -->
    </providers>
    <actions>
      ... <!-- list of the actions activated for the import -->
    </actions>
    <consolidators>
      ... <!-- list of the consolidators activated for the import -->
    </consolidators>
    <postProcess>
    	...<!-- list of the postProcess activated for the import -->
    </postProcess>
  </import>

  <import>
    ... <!-- the description of a second import file -->
  </import>
</import-config>

```

## Pre-processing

The pre-process function allows you to preform changes to the file prior to importing.

## Consolidators

A consolidator is a functionality that is executed at the end of each import file, after all the other actions. (eg. when moving the CSV file inside the backup folder).

In order to work properly, the consolidators must be declared in a specific order:

`timestamp` | Whether to prepend the timestamp to the import file when moving it to the backup folder. | yesNoElement | Yes | No |

`String '..' is forbidden in in/output path folder`	| For security reasons, the string '..' is forbidden in both the inputFolder and outputFolder.
`The input folder [...] does not exists.` | The specified inputFolder does not exist.
`The output folder [...] does not exists or can not be created.` | The specified outputFolder does not exist and an unexpected error occured during its creation. This is probably a folder rights problem.
`Can not copy the file [...] to [...]` | An unexpected error occured while trying to copy the files to the destination folder. This is probably a folder rights problem.
